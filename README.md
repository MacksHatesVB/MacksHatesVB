### Hello, I am Max, I'm a 17 yr old student with a passion for IT Cyber Security and Programming.

I have been programming since the age of 12, starting off with Python. I learned the fundamental core of programming during these earlier years, after 4 years I started learning low-level languages such as C and C++ while learning how to use Linux, now as I am 17 nearly 18 I have an extensive knowledge of computers which I hope to apply in real life.

I daily drive EndeavourOs Linux on my main computer, my choice of endeavour came from my love for the bleeding-edge and blazingly fast Arch Linux and my contradicting want for simplicity and efficiency. I came to the conclusion that endeavour would be the best choice for me. And on my laptop I have a tri-boot between Arch Linux, Windows 10 and Fedora Linux.
